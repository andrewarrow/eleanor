If you just want to run Eleanor from the command line and aren't interested
in using it from other Ruby programs, you don't have to install it.  Just
download the tarball or zip package from http://rubyforge.org/projects/eleanor,
extract it to some directory, and off you go.

= Running without Installing

Extract your package and

  cd eleanor-1.0.0
  ruby bin/eleanor screenplay.txt

=== Building the Example

An example plain text screenplay is located in the examples directory in the
package.  To generate the PDF, run

  rake examples

This example can also be found at http://eleanor.rubyforge.org/example.txt.


= Installing through RubyGems

  gem install eleanor

Or, manually download the gem from http://rubyforge.org/projects/eleanor and

  gem install eleanor-1.0.0.gem


= Installing to site_ruby

From your extracted package directory,

  rake install

Or, equivalently,

  ruby setup.rb

This installation method uses the setup.rb script by
{Minero Aoki}[http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/setup].
